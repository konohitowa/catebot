# CateBot Information

## FAQ

### What is CateBot?
CateBot is a reddit bot that is triggered by Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) paragraph references in reddit comments as well as references to other documents of the Roman Catholic Church. It posts the contents of the requested selection(s) as a reply to the comment that contained the request.

### Where is it currently being used?
CateBot is currently running on the following subreddits:

* [/r/Catholicism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/)
* [/r/Christianity](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/)

### What documents does CateBot currently support?
CateBot currently supports quoting the following Catholic Church documents (the abbreviation recognized by CateBot to quote that document follows the name of the document in parenthesis):

* [Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC)](http://usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catechism/catechism-of-the-catholic-church/)
* [Code of Canon Law (Can)](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM)
* [General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM)](http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/)

**Note**: The command used to invoke the various documents is case insensitive, so CCC = Ccc = ccc, etc.

### How do I use it?
If you want CateBot to quote a Catechism paragraph from your comment, simply surround the paragraph number in brackets and precede the number with CCC ([CCC 1234]). CateBot also understands a few slightly more advanced syntaxes. To start with, the CCC tag is case-insensitive, so [ccc 1234] would work just as well. In addition, you aren't limited to just one paragraph: you can specific multiple paragraphs separated by commas, and you can specify a range of paragraphs using a hyphen.

### Can you give me some examples of how to use the bot?
Using the reference [ccc 1] would ask CateBot to quote the 1st paragraph of the CCC.

Multiple paragraphs such as [ccc 3,120,72] can also be requested.

And rather than using [ccc 2105,2106,2107] you could just specify a range using [ccc 2105-2107]. A range **must**
be in ascending order (i.e., [smallernumber - largernumber]).

And you can always mix and match like so: [ccc 3,2105-2107].

You don't _have_ to include the space after the ccc tag, but [ccc5] doesn't look nearly as clean. You can also include spaces after the commas, such as [ccc 3, 2105].

The General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM) uses the same syntax rules ([GIRM 7]) but there is a slightly variant syntax for the Code of Canon Law due to the inclusion of numbered paragraphs within each law. So, for example, Can. 239 consists of 3 sections. If you wanted the entire law, you would use [can 239]. To just see paragraph 1, you would use [can 239s1]. And, if you wanted to see just paragraphs 2 and 3, you would use [can 239s2-3]. Other than that, the syntax is the same as the other commands in that you can include multiple law requests separated by commas within the same command.

_Remember, the paragraph references can be located **ANYWHERE** in your comment!_

### What happens if I quote a non-existent paragraph of a document?
CateBot ignores it.

### How many paragraphs can I quote?
You are limited by the maximum size of a reddit response. The reddit API has a limit of 10,000 characters in
a post; CateBot arbitrarily lowers this 8,000 characters. If the response is larger than that, CateBot
lets you know and assembles a listing of links only rather than links with text. If this is also too large,
it links as many paragraphs as it can and then gives an additional message letting you know that you exceeded
that, too. This limit is being increased (see [Issue \#42](https://github.com/konohitowa/catebot/issues/42)).

### Wait. I've counted the characters and I didn't hit the limit!
Look at the source instead; the links take up a fair amount of text. Looking at source is a [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com) feature.

### Why is the bot not responding to my comment?
This could be attributed to a few different things (in no particular order):
* Your paragraph reference doesn't follow the guidelines specified above.
* The bot is down temporarily for maintenance/updates.
* The bot has a connectivity issue to the Internet.
* The bot is trying to keep up with commands (reddit limits the rate of scanning as well as how frequently the bot can respond).
* Reddit is having issues (you can check for those [here](https://reddit.statuspage.io).

### Why does the bot respond to a request for Church documents and Bible verses with two different messages?
Currently, there are two different bots running using the same account. One of them handles Church documents and the other handles Bible verses. This happened because Versebot was taken down so Catebot was filling in temporarily using the Versebot code. This was expected to be a temmporary situation but has ended up being a much longer term situation. The long term solution is to merge the Catebot and Versebot code into the same bot (see [Issue \#37](https://github.com/konohitowa/catebot/issues/37)).

### How do you pronounce CateBot?
Like cate-chism. But, you know, with 'bot' in place of 'chism'.

### What should I do if I still have questions?
Just ask me! You can [contact me on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kono_hito_wa).

### Is there any end matter to this FAQ?
Yes!

Okay - just kidding. I *would* link to thank the moderators of and contributors to [/r/Catholicsm](http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism) for putting up with my testing as well as generating test cases and suggestions/feedback. And a big thanks to [Matthieu Grieger](http://www.reddit.com/u/mgrieger) for open sourcing [versebot on github](http://github.com/matthieugrieger/versebot). If he hadn't done that, I highly doubt I would have had the ambition to build this from scratch and, if I had, it would have taken me significantly longer.
