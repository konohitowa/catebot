PRAYERS


THE LORD'S PRAYER

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name: Thy kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass
against us: and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.


THE ANGELICAL SALUTATION

Hail Mary, full of grace! the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou
amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary,
Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.


THE APOSTLES' CREED

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and
in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified; died, and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day
He arose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the
right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to
judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost the Holy
Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.


THE CONFITEOR

I confess to Almighty God, to blessed Mary, ever Virgin, to blessed
Michael the Archangel, to blessed John the Baptist, to the holy Apostles
Peter and Paul, and to all the Saints, that I have sinned exceedingly in
thought, word and deed, through my fault, through my fault, through my
most grievous fault. Therefore, I beseech blessed Mary, ever Virgin,
blessed Michael the Archangel, blessed John the Baptist, the holy
Apostles Peter and Paul, and all the Saints, to pray to the Lord our God
for me.

May the Almighty God have mercy on me, and forgive me my sins, and bring
me to everlasting life. Amen.

May the Almighty and merciful Lord grant me pardon, absolution, and
remission of all my sins. Amen.


AN ACT OF FAITH

O my God! I firmly believe that Thou art one God in three Divine
Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; I believe that Thy Divine Son
became man, and died for our sins, and that he will come to judge the
living and the dead. I believe these and all the truths which the Holy
Catholic Church teaches, because Thou hast revealed them, who canst
neither deceive nor be deceived.


AN ACT OF HOPE

O my God! relying on Thy infinite goodness and promises, I hope to
obtain pardon of my sins, the help of Thy grace, and life everlasting,
through the merits of Jesus Christ, my Lord and Redeemer.


AN ACT OF LOVE

O my God! I love Thee above all things, with my whole heart and soul,
because Thou art all-good and worthy of all love. I love my neighbor as
myself for the love of Thee. I forgive all who have injured me, and ask
pardon of all whom I have injured.


AN ACT OF CONTRITION

O my God! I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all
my sins, because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell, but
most of all because they offend Thee, my God, who art all-good and
deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace,
to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life.


THE BLESSING BEFORE MEALS

+ Bless us, O Lord! and these Thy gifts, which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.


GRACE AFTER MEALS

+ We give Thee thanks for all Thy benefits, O Almighty God, who livest
and reignest forever, and may the souls of the faithful departed
through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.

STOP_PARSING


MORNING PRAYERS


As soon as you awake, think of God. Make the Sign of the Cross and say:

+ In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.

Then dress quickly and kneel down. Now say the Our Father, the Hail
Mary, the Apostles' Creed, the Confiteor and the Acts of Faith, Hope,
Love and Contrition which you have probably memorized. If you do not
know them by heart you will find them on pages 2-4.

Then if you have time also say the following prayers:

TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN.
My Lady, and my Mother, remember I am thine; protect and defend me as
thy property and possession.

TO SAINT JOSEPH.
Saint Joseph, model and patron of those who love the Sacred Heart of
Jesus, pray for us.

TO THE GUARDIAN ANGEL.
Angel of God, my guardian dear,
To whom His love commits me here,
Ever this day be at my side,
To light and guard, to rule and guide. Amen.

God bless Papa and Mamma. God bless Brothers and Sisters, and all my
friends. God bless me, and make me a good child.

FOR THE FAITHFUL DEPARTED.
Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord. And let perpetual light shine upon
them. May they rest in peace. Amen.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was
in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

Make the Sign of the Cross.



EVENING PRAYERS


Never go to bed without thanking God for all the benefits you have
received during the day and during your whole life. Kneel down. Make the
Sign of the Cross. Then say the Our Father, Hail Mary, the Apostles'
Creed, the Confiteor, and Glory be.

Now think how you have acted during the day. Are there any big sins on
your soul? Any little sins? Try to tell Jesus how sorry you are for all
your sins, and say the Act of Contrition (page 4).

Jesus, Mary, Joseph, I give you my heart and my soul.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, assist me in my last agony.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, may I breathe forth my soul in peace with you.
O my God, bless my father, mother, and all my relatives and friends.
May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest
in peace. Amen.

Bless yourself with holy water.

+ In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

PRAYERS FOR MASS


[The Mass prayers are an arrangement of those contained in Father Finn's
"Prayer Book for Catholic Youth" (also known as Father Finn's Boys' and
Girls' Prayer Book). They follow closely in simplified language the
spirit and liturgy of the "Ordinary of the Mass," so that children will
become readily accustomed to using the Church's own prayers and follow
the priest at the altar. The rubrics when to sit, stand or kneel at Low
Mass are given.

If it is found desirable to have the children recite prayers aloud and
in unison at Mass, certain parts suitable for this purpose are marked
with an asterisk (*).]


Remember that the church is the house of God, where the living God
dwells. And where God is, His holy angels too are present. In church,
therefore, be reverent and modest in your behavior, and always be in
time. When you enter, bless yourself with holy water and go quietly to
your seat, genuflect on your right knee and enter the pew.


PRAYER BEFORE MASS

O my God, I am only a child; help me to be attentive, and to pray with
all my heart during this holy Mass.

The priest comes out to begin Mass.

Stand

The priest carries in his hands the chalice, covered with a cloth. The
priest goes up to the middle of the altar, and sets down the chalice.
Then he goes to the right side and opens the book.

After that he comes down to the foot of the altar, and makes the Sign of
the Cross.


THE MASS OF THE CATECHUMENS
(From the Beginning to the Offertory)

Kneel

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
*I will go in to the altar of God, to God Who gives joy to my youth.
*Judge me, O God. Keep me safe from all evil.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost.
As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.
Amen.
I will go in to the altar of God.
To God Who gives joy to my youth.

Here the priest makes the Sign of the Cross.

Our help is in the name of the Lord.
Who made heaven and earth.

The priest, bowing down, says the Confiteor. Then the altar-boys bow and
say it after him. Read it as on p. 2.

The priest goes up to the altar and says:

O Lord, we beg You, by the goodness of Your saints whose relics are
here, and of all Your saints, to forgive us all our sins.


THE INTROIT AND KYRIE ELEISON

The priest goes to the right side of the altar and reads from the book.
Then going back to the middle of the altar he says the Kyrie Eleison.


THE GLORIA

Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace to men of good will. We
praise You. We bless You. We glorify You. We give You thanks for Your
great glory, O Lord God, heavenly King, God the Father almighty. O Lord
God, Son of the Father, Who take away the sins of the world, have mercy
on us. You only, O Jesus Christ, with the Holy Ghost, are most high in
the Glory of God the Father. Amen.

The priest turns to the people and says:

The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.


THE COLLECT

The priest goes to the right side of the altar and reads from the book.

*Let us pray: Let Your grace and pity guide our hearts, we beg You, O
Lord. For without You we cannot please You. Through Our Lord, Jesus
Christ, Your Son, Who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy
Ghost, world without end. Amen.


THE EPISTLE

The Epistle is a letter. Most of these letters were written by Saint
Paul. The priest now reads one of these. You may read the following:

Dear children: Be happy, be good, be brave; agree with one another, and
be at peace. The grace of Our Lord Jesus Christ, God's love, and the
wisdom of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.

Thanks be to God.

The altar-boy carries the book to the left side of the altar. The priest
bows at the middle of the altar and says a prayer.


THE GOSPEL

The priest goes to the left and reads from the book.

Stand

While Jesus was speaking to the people, mothers brought their children
to Him, that He might bless them. The disciples told them not to bother
Jesus. But Jesus said, "Suffer the little children to come to Me and
forbid them not. For of such is the kingdom of heaven." And Jesus
blessed the children.

Praise be to You, O Christ.

Sit

The priest now turns back to the middle of the altar and says the Creed.
You also say it (see page 2).


THE MASS OF THE FAITHFUL
(From the Offertory to the Communion)


THE OFFERING OF THE HOST

The priest takes the cloth off the chalice. Then he holds up a small
gold plate on which is the bread, called the host.

*Take, O holy Father, almighty and eternal God, this spotless host which
I, Your unworthy servant, offer to You for my many sins and for all who
serve You, living and dead. May it help them and me to gain eternal
life.

The priest goes to the right side of the altar. He pours wine and water
into the chalice. Then the priest goes back to the middle of the altar
and raises the chalice.


THE OFFERING OF THE CHALICE

*We offer You, O Lord, this chalice. May it help us and all the world to
gain eternal life. Amen.

The priest goes to the right side of the altar to wash his hands.

Returning to the middle of the altar, the priest bows down and says some
prayers. Then he turns to the people and says the Orate Fratres.

Now the priest prays in a low voice and then in a louder voice he says
the Preface:

Truly, it is right and just that we should at all times and in all
places give thanks to You, O holy Lord, Father almighty, Who, with Your
only Son and the Holy Ghost are one God, one Lord. All the angels daily
praise You, singing with one voice:


*THE SANCTUS

Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of Your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.

The bell is rung three times.

Kneel


THE CANON

[Note,--By a Decree of the Church (Aug. 4, 1922), the prayers during the
Canon, i.e. from the Sanctus to the Pater Noster, must be said in
silence.]

The priest bows low and kisses the altar.

O most merciful Father, we pray You, through Jesus Christ, Your Son, Our
Lord, to take and bless these gifts. We offer them to You for Your holy
Catholic Church, for our Pope and Bishop and for all those in the
Catholic Faith.


PRAYER FOR THE LIVING

Be mindful, O Lord, of Your servants (name those for whom you wish to
pray especially), and all who are now hearing this Mass. Hear, O Lord,
the prayers they are offering for themselves, their friends and their
families.


THE CONSECRATION OF THE HOST

The priest now bends low over the host and says:

    THIS IS MY BODY

At these words, the bread is changed into the body of Our Lord. The bell
rings. The priest kneels and then raises the Sacred Body of Our Lord.
Now look at the Sacred Host and say: My Lord and my God. Then bow your
head as the priest kneels again.


THE CONSECRATION OF THE WINE

The priest bends over the chalice and says:

    THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD

At these words, the wine becomes the Precious Blood of Our Lord. The
bell rings. The priest kneels and then raises the chalice. Now the
priest continues to pray silently. Look at the chalice and say: Jesus in
the Blessed Sacrament, have mercy on us.

The priest kneels. The bell rings again. The priest prays silently.


PRAYER FOR THE DEAD

Remember also, O Lord, Your servants (here name dead relatives and
friends) who have gone before us with the sign of faith and sleep the
sleep of peace.

Now the priest says the "Pater Noster." Say the "Our Father."

Soon after the priest strikes his breast and says the "Agnus Dei."


THE PRIEST'S COMMUNION

The priest after saying some prayers silently, takes the Sacred Host and
paten in his left hand and striking his breast with the right hand says
(the bell rings three times):

*O Lord, I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof. Say but
the word and my soul shall be healed.

The priest bows down and receives the Body of Our Lord. He remains in
prayer for a short time. Then he uncovers the chalice and drinks the
Sacred Blood of Our Lord.


THE COMMUNION OF THE PEOPLE

The priest now opens the tabernacle and takes out the Blessed Sacrament
to give holy communion to the people. Turning to the people and holding
the ciborium in his left hand, he lifts up a Sacred Host to the people
in his right hand. Now say with the priest three times:

"Lord, I am not worthy that You should enter my soul; say but the word
and my soul shall be healed."


AFTER THE COMMUNION

Having replaced the Blessed Sacrament in the tabernacle, the priest
after taking water and wine, covers the chalice and goes to the right
side of the altar to read from the book. Then going back to the middle
he turns to the people and says:

The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.

Then the priest again goes to the right side of the altar and reads:


THE PRAYERS AFTER COMMUNION

*Let us pray: We have been filled with Your gifts, O Lord. Grant that
they may make us clean and strong. May the gift of this divine Sacrament
keep us pure, O Lord. Through the help of the Blessed Virgin, of St.
Joseph, of Sts. Peter and Paul and all the saints, may it free us from
all evil.

The priest goes back to the middle of the altar and turning to the
people says:

The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.

Go, the Mass is ended.
Thanks be to God.


THE BLESSING

The priest bows down and says a prayer. Then turning to the people he
blesses them saying:

May almighty God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, bless you. Amen.

The priest goes to the left side of the altar.

Stand

The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.


THE LAST GOSPEL

The priest makes a cross on forehead, lips, and breast, and says the
Gospel of St. John.

Remain standing until the priest has left the sanctuary or kneels down
to say the prayers after Mass.



THE RIGHT MANNER OF CONFESSING


[From Father Finn's Prayer Book for Catholic Youth.]


PRAYER BEFORE EXAMINING YOUR CONSCIENCE

O Holy Spirit, help me to know all my sins. Help me to remember that
Jesus died for me. Help me to make a good confession and I promise that
I will try never to sin again.

Now think of your sins.


PRAYER BEFORE ENTERING THE CONFESSIONAL

O God, I am very sorry for all my sins. I promise that I will try to be
good and never again to hurt You by sin. Dear Jesus, help me. Mother of
God, pray that I may please Your Son by true sorrow for my sins.

When your turn comes, go into the confession box. Make the Sign of the
Cross and wait till the priest opens the little door. Say what you have
been taught to say. Or you may say this:

Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It is (say how long) since my last
confession. Since then I have committed these sins.

Now tell all your sins and how many times you committed each. If there
is something you don't know how to tell, just say, "Please help me,
Father," and the priest will help you. After you have told all your
sins, say what you have been taught to say. Or you may say:

That is all, Father.

In case you have no big sins to confess, it is well to end your
confession with: "In my past life I sinned through anger or impurity"
(or some sin that you know you did and that you are sorry for).

The priest tells you what prayers to say for a penance. Then he tells
you to say the Act of Contrition. When you come out, kneel down near the
altar. Say your penance at once. Then thank God for being so good to
you.



COMMUNION PRAYERS


ACTS BEFORE COMMUNION

Thou art really present in the Holy Eucharist, and that it is Thy body,
Thy blood, Thy soul, and Thy divinity that I shall receive in that
Adorable Sacrament.

Act of Hope. Thou hast said, O my God, that those hoping in Thee shall
never be confounded. I place all my confidence in Thy promises, and I
hope that, having nourished myself with Thy body on earth, I shall have
the happiness of seeing and possessing Thee eternally in heaven.

Act of Love. O my divine Jesus, Who hast so loved me as to nourish me
with Thy adorable flesh, I love Thee with all my heart and above all
things; I wish to live and die in Thy holy love.

sick, and Thou hast healed me. I was poor, and Thou hast bestowed upon
me Thy numberless benefits. How shall I be able to thank Thee, O my
Lord, for all Thy favors? I will invoke Thy holy name, and eternally
sing Thy mercies.

Act of Offering. What can I offer Thee, O my God, for the grace of
having given Thyself to me? I consecrate to Thy glory my body, my soul,
and all that I possess! Dispose of me according to Thy holy will.

Do not let the enemy of my salvation ravish the precious treasure I bear

Jesus, My Lord, My God
(REV. F. W. FABER)

1. Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all!
  How can I love Thee as I ought?
And how revere this wondrous gift,
  So far surpassing hope or thought?

CHORUS.--Sweet Sacrament! we Thee adore,
Oh, make us love Thee more and more,
Oh, make us love Thee more and more.

2. Had I but Mary's sinless heart
  To love Thee with, my dearest King,
Oh, with what bursts of fervent praise
  Thy goodness, Jesus, would I sing!


To Jesus' Heart All Burning
(REV. A. J. CHRISTIE, S.J.)

1. To Jesus' Heart, all burning
  With fervent love for men,
My heart with fondest yearning
  Shall raise the joyful strain.

CHORUS.--While ages course along,
Blest be with loudest song
|| The Sacred Heart of Jesus
By every heart and tongued. ||

2. O Heart for me on fire
  With love no man can speak,
My yet untold desire
  God gives me for Thy sake.

3. Too true I have forsaken
  Thy flock by wilful sin;
Yet now let me be taken
  Back to Thy fold again.


Jesus, Gentlest Saviour
(REV. F. W. FABER)

1. Jesus, gentlest Saviour!
  God of might and power;
Thou Thyself art dwelling
  In us at this hour.
Nature cannot hold Thee,
  Heav'n is all too strait
For Thine endless glory,
  And Thy royal state.

2. Out beyond the shining
  Of the farthest star,
Thou art ever stretching
  Infinitely far.
Yet the hearts of children
  Hold what worlds cannot,
And the God of wonders
  Loves the lowly spot.


Jesus! Saviour of My Soul

1. Jesus! Saviour of my soul,
  Let me to Thy refuge fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
  While the tempest still is nigh.

CHORUS.--Hide me, O my Saviour, hide
  Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into Thy haven guide,
  O receive my soul at last.
Jesus! Saviour of my soul,
  Let me to Thy refuge fly;
Ave, Ave, Jesus mild,
  Deign to hear Thy lowly child.

2. Other refuge have I none,
  Hangs my helpless soul on Thee,
Leave, oh, leave me not alone,
  Still support and strengthen me.


Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee
(REV. E. CASWALL)

1. Jesus, the very thought of Thee
  With rapture fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy Face to see,
  And in Thy presence rest.

2. Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
  Nor can the mem'ry find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,
  O Saviour of mankind!

3. Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
  As Thou our prize wilt be;
O Jesus, be our glory now
  And through eternity.


What Happiness Can Equal Mine?
(REV. F. W. FABER)

1. What happiness can equal mine?
  I've found the object of my love:
My Jesus dear, my King Divine,
  Is come to me from heav'n above;
He chose my heart for His abode,
  He there becomes my daily bread;
There on me flows His healing blood;
  There with His flesh my soul is fed.

CHORUS.--What happiness can equal mine?
  I've found the object of my love:
My Jesus dear, my King Divine,
  Is come to me from heav'n above.

2. I am my love's, and He is mine:
  In me He dwells, in Him I live;
What greater treasures could I find?
  And could, ye heavens, a greater give?
O sacred banquet, heav'nly feast!
  O overflowing source of grace,
Where God the food, and man, the guest,
  Meet and unite in sweet embrace!


The Love of Jesus

1. O the priceless love of Jesus:
  O the strength of grace divine;
All His gifts are showered upon me,
  All His blessings may be mine.
He is throned in Heavenly glory
  Where no sin nor death can be;
Yet He loves me in this darkness,
  Yet He does not turn from me.

2. I am blind, and poor, and wretched,
  By temptations sorely tried;
Yet His watchful care abounding
  Keeps me ever at His side.
He is God and King Eternal,
  Higher than all height can be;
Yet His Heart is with me always,
  Yet He stoopeth down to me.


Holy God, We Praise Thy Name
(REV. C. WALWORTH)

1. Holy God, we praise Thy name,
  Lord of all, we bow before Thee!
All on earth Thy sceptre claim,
  All in heav'n above adore Thee.
|| Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy name. ||

2. Hark! the loud celestial hymn,
  Angel choirs above are raising!
Cherubim and Seraphim,
  In unceasing chorus praising.
|| Fill the heavens with sweet accord;
  Holy! Holy! Holy Lord. ||


Hail, Heavenly Queen!

1. Hail, heavenly Queen! Hail, foamy ocean star!
O be our guide, diffuse thy beams afar;
Hail, Mother of God! above all virgins blest,
Hail, happy gate of heav'n's eternal rest.

CHORUS.--Hail foamy ocean star! Hail, heav'nly Queen!
|| O be our guide to endless joys unseen. ||

2. "Hail, full of grace," with Gabriel we repeat;
Thee, Queen of heav'n, from him we learn to greet;
Then give us peace which heav'n alone can give,
And dead thro' Eve, thro' Mary let us live.


Mother Dear, Oh, Pray for Me

1. Mother dear, oh, pray for me,
  Whilst far from heav'n and thee
I wander in a fragile bark,
  O'er life's tempestuous sea;
O Virgin Mother, from thy throne,
  So bright in bliss above,
Protect thy child and cheer my path,
  With thy sweet smile of love.

CHORUS.--Mother dear, remember me,
  And never cease thy care,
Till in heaven eternally
  Thy love and bliss I share.

2. Mother dear, oh, pray for me,
  Should pleasure's siren lay
E'er tempt thy child to wander far
  From virtue's path away;
When thorns beset life's devious way,
  And darkling waters flow,
Then, Mary, aid thy weeping child,
  Thyself a mother show.


Ora Pro Me

1. Ave Maria! bright and pure,
  Hear, O hear me when I pray,
Pains and pleasures try the pilgrim
  On his long and dreary way.
Fears and perils are around me,
Ave Maria! bright and pure,
  Ore pro me, ora pro me.

2. Ave Maria! Queen of Heaven,
  Teach, O teach me to obey,
Lead me on, tho' fierce temptations
  Stand and meet me in the way.
When I fail and faint, my Mother,
Ave Maria! bright and pure,
  Ora pro me, ora pro me.


I'll Sing a Hymn to Mary
(REV. FR. WYSE)

I'll sing a hymn to Mary,
  The Mother of my God,
The Virgin of all Virgins,
  Of David's royal blood.
Oh, teach me, holy Mary
  A loving song to frame,
When wicked men blaspheme thee
  To love and bless thy name.

When troubles dark afflict me
  In sorrow and in care,
Thy light doth ever guide me
  O beauteous Morning Star.
Lo, I'll be ever ready
  Thy goodly help to claim,
When wicked men blaspheme thee
  I'll love and bless thy name.


Daily, Daily Sing to Mary

1. Daily, daily sing to Mary
  Sing, my soul, her praises due;
All her feasts, her actions worship,
  With the heart's devotion true.
Lost in wond'ring contemplation,
  Be her majesty confess'd;
Call her Mother, call her Virgin,
  Happy Mother, Virgin blest.

2. She is mighty to deliver;
  Call her, trust her lovingly;
When the tempest rages round thee,
  She will calm the troubled sea.
Gifts of heaven she has given,
  Noble Lady, to our race;
She the Queen who decks her subject,
  With the light of God's own grace.


Hymn to St. Joseph

1. With grateful hearts we breathe to-day
  The tender accents of our love.
We carol forth a little lay
  To thee, great saint in heaven above.

CHORUS.--O Joseph dear, from thy bright throne,
  Incline thine ear unto our prayer.
And o'er us all as o'er thine own,
  Extend thy fond paternal care,
And o'er us all as o'er thine own,
  Extend thy fond paternal care,
Extend thy fond paternal care.

2. More favored than earth's greatest king.
  Thou wert the guardian of that Child,
Around whose crib full choirs did sing,
  With cadenced voices soft and mild.


Dear Guardian of Mary
(REV. F. W. FABER)

1. Dear Guardian of Mary! dear nurse of her child!
Life's ways are full weary, the desert is wild;
Bleak sands are all round us, no home can we see;
Sweet Spouse of our Lady! we lean upon thee.

2. For thou to the pilgrim art father and guide,
And Jesus and Mary felt safe at thy side;
Ah! blessed Saint Joseph, how safe should I be,
Sweet Spouse of our Lady! if thou wert with me.


Dear Angel, Ever at My Side
(REV. F. W. FABER)

1. Dear Angel, ever at my side,
  How loving must thou be,
To leave thy home in heaven to guide
  A little child like me.

2. Thy beautiful and shining face
  I see not, though so near;
The sweetness of thy soft, low voice
  I am too deaf to hear.


Hymn at the Communion

O Lord, I am not worthy
  That Thou shouldst come to me,
But speak the words of comfort,
  My spirit healed shall be.

And humbly I'll receive Thee,
  The bridegroom of my soul,
No more by sin to grieve Thee,
  Or fly Thy sweet control.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net
